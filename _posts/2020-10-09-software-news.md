The Software Working Group is working on physics and detector
simulations that enable a quantitative assessment of the measurement
capabilities of the EIC detector(s) and their physics impact for the
Yellow Report Initiative. The common simulation tools and workflow
environment being set up by the working group allow the EICUG to
pursue the Yellow Report studies in a manner that is accessible,
consistent, and reproducible.
