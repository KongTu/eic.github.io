#### Accelerator and Beam Conditions Critical for EIC Simulations

Measurements at the EIC will be influenced by various accelerator and
beam effects: the crossing angle, the crabbing rotation, the beam
energy spread, the angular beam divergence, and the bunch length. The
SWG participated in a note on these effects:

 The accelerator and beam effects studied in the note need to be included
in physics and detector simulations for the EIC. They can have
profound consequences of the measurement capabilities of the EIC and
the design and layout of the detectors. Of particular interest are,
e.g., analysis of azimuthal modulations in the cross section that
reveal insights on GPDs or TMDs and the possible fake asymmetries
being caused by the accelerator and beam effects.

The authors provide a movie showing the electron and proton bunch
movement during their interaction. The visualization is for an electron-proton
collision at 18x275 GeV and based on the transport model described in the note.
