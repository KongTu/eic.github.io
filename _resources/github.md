### GitHub Organization

{% include navigation/findlink.md name='github' tag='The EIC GitHub Organization' %} is available for the whole EICUG. For membership, please send your GitHub username to [eicug-computing-infrastructure-support@eicug.org](mailto:eicug-computing-infrastructure-support@eicug.org?subject=GitHub%20Account)


### GitHub Guidelines

We encourage you to share your software and documentation on {% include navigation/findlink.md name='github' tag='https://github.com/eic' %}. Please follow our guidelines in doing so: 

* Please use a unique name for your repository so that we can easily identify projects. We will, e.g., have various Geant4 related projects and each of these projects should have a name that is distinguishable from the others (and not Geant4). 
* Please {% include navigation/findlink.md name='github_adding_topics' tag='add at least one topic to your repository' %}.
* Please give a clear description of your repository, e.g., ”Mary Johnson (Lab)’s DVCS MC” or “William's Smith (University) DIS analysis”.
