### GitHub Guidelines

We encourage you to share your software and documentation on [https://github.com/eic](https://github.com/eic). Please follow our guidelines in doing so: 

* Please use a unique name for your repository so that we can easily identify projects. We will, e.g., have various Geant4 related projects and each of these projects should have a name that is distinguishable from the others (and not Geant4). 
* Please [add at least one topic to your repository](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#adding-topics-to-your-repository). 
* Please give a clear description of your repository, e.g., ”Mary Johnson (Lab)’s DVCS MC” or “William's Smith (University) DIS analysis”.
